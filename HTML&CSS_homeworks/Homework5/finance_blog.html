            <h3 id="first">Tips and tricks on how to save money</h3>
            <h4>Record your expenses</h4>
            <p>The first step to start saving money is to figure out how much you spend. Keep track of all your expenses—that means every coffee, household item and cash tip.Once you have your data, organize the numbers by categories, such as gas, groceries and mortgage, and total each amount. Use your credit card and bank statements to make sure you’re accurate—and don’t forget any.</p>

            <h4>Find ways you can cut your spendings</h4>
            <p>If your expenses are so high that you can’t save as much as you’d like, it might be time to cut back. Identify nonessentials that you can spend less on, such as entertainment and dining out. Look for ways to save on your fixed monthly expenses like television and your cell phone, too.</p>
            <p>Here are some ideas for cutting your everyday spendings</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use resources such as community event listings to find free or low-cost events to reduce entertainment spending.</li>
                <li>Cancel subscriptions and memberships you don’t use—especially if they renew automatically.</li>
                <li>Give yourself a “cooling off period”: When tempted by a nonessential purchase, wait a few days. You may be glad you passed—or ready to save up for it.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Set savings goals</h4>
            <p>One of the best ways to save money is to set a goal. Start by thinking of what you might want to save for—perhaps you’re getting married, planning a vacation or saving for retirement. Then figure out how much money you’ll need and how long it might take you to save it.</p>
            
            <h4>Decide on your priorities</h4>
            <p>After your expenses and income, your goals are likely to have the biggest impact on how you allocate your savings. Be sure to remember long-term goals—it’s important that planning for retirement doesn’t take a back seat to shorter-term needs.</p>

            <h4>Make saving automatic</h4>
            <p>Almost all banks offer automated transfers between your checking and savings accounts. You can choose when, how much and where to transfer money or even split your direct deposit so a portion of every paycheck goes directly into your savings account.</p>

            <h4>Watch your savings grow</h4>
            <p>Review your budget and check your progress every month. Not only will this help you stick to your personal savings plan, but it also helps you identify and fix problems quickly. Understanding how to save money may even inspire you to find more ways to save and hit your goals faster.</p>

            <h3 id="second">How to make budget in six simple steps</h3>
            <h4>Gather your financial paperwork</h4>
            <p>Before you begin, gather up all your financial statements, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bank statements</li>
                <li>Investment accounts</li>
                <li>Utility bills</li>
                <li>Credit card bills</li>
                <li>Receipts from the last three months</li>
                <li>Mortgage or auto loan statements</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Calculate your income</h4>
            <p>How much income can you expect each month? If your income is in the form of a regular paycheck where taxes are automatically deducted, then using the net income (or take-home pay) amount is fine. If you are self-employed or have outside sources of income, such as child support or Social Security, include these as well. Record this total income as a monthly amount.</p>

            <h4>Create a list of monthy expenses</h4>
            <p>Write down a list of all the expenses you expect to have during a month. This list could include: mortgage payments or rent, car payments, insurance, groceries, utilities, entertaiment, personal care, transportation, travel, savings etc.</p>

            <h4>Determine fixed and variable costs</h4>
            <p>Fixed expenses are those mandatory expenses that you pay the same amount for each time. Include items like mortgage or rent payments, car payments, set-fee internet service, trash pickup, and regular childcare. If you pay a standard credit card payment, include that amount and any other essential spending that tends to stay the same from month to month. If you plan to save a fixed amount or pay off a certain amount of debt each month, also include savings and debt repayment as fixed expenses.</p>

            <h4>Total your monthly income and expenses</h4>
            <p>If your income is higher than your expenses, you are off to a good start. This extra money means you can put funds towards areas of your budget, such as retirement savings or paying off debt.</p>

            <h4>Make adjustments to expenses</h4>
            <p>If you're in a situation where expenses are higher than income, find areas in your variable expenses you can cut. Look for places you can reduce your spending—like eating out less—or eliminate a category—like canceling your gym membership.</p>

            <h3 id="third">How to reduce or eliminate debt</h3>
            <h4>Stop accumulating debt</h4>
            <p>If you don't have one already, now is a great time to create a budget. A budget helps you bring your spending in line with your income, making the most of each dollar that comes in and ensuring you don't need to use credit cards or loans to make ends meet.</p>
            
            <h4>Build an emergency fund</h4>
            <p>Putting money in an emergency fund may sound counterintuitive if you’re trying to get out of debt—you could be using that money to pay off your debt instead of sticking it in a savings account—but an emergency fund can actually keep you from creating more debt. These savings provide you with a safety net you can use for emergency expenses, which saves you from reaching for your credit card.</p>

            <h4>Use the debt snowball method</h4>
            <p>The less you pay toward your debt balances every month, the longer it'll take to pay them off. Interest can exponentially expand the timeline for your debt repayment, and most debt balances rack up interest charges every month.</p>

            <h4>Increase your income</h4>
            <p>The more money you put toward your debt, the faster you can pay it off for good. Look for ways to come up with extra money to dedicate to your debt. For example, you could earn extra cash by selling items from your home, starting a side hustle, or generating income from a hobby. You may be able to earn more money from your full-time job by negotiating a raise or working more hours.</p>

            <h4>Cash out a life insurance policy</h4>
            <p>You may have accumulated some cash in your whole or universal life insurance policy that you can put toward your debt. Like tapping retirement funds, this is a risky strategy that can come with tax consequences. Cashing out means surrendering your life insurance policy, and it will no longer be in effect. Borrowing from your insurance policy may also be an option, but it may affect the death benefit your beneficiaries will receive.</p>

            <h4>Dept settlement</h4>
            <p>Debt settlement may be a solution if your accounts are past due or you owe more money than you could repay over a few years. When you settle your debts, you ask the creditor to accept a one-time, lump-sum payment that’s lower than the full balance to satisfy the debt in full. Creditors typically only accept settlement offers on accounts that are in default or at risk of defaulting. However, debt settlement can negatively affect your credit score, so it should only be used as a last resort.</p>
